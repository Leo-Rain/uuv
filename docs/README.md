Welcome to the wiki of the `uuv` project!

Here you can find up-to-date information on the `uuv` repository.

First of all, the repository contains software that is used to simulate and control a single ROV in the Matlab/Simulink environment.

# Current status

The code is still not fully functional. At the moment, the following items have been implemented:
* Directory in recommended Matlab/Simulink project format;
* ROV 6DOF dynamics block in Simulink (C S-function), including added mass, damping and hydrostatic forces;
* An external current (Matlab/Simulink);
* A thrust block in Simulink (C S-function) that takes propeller revolutions as input and returns the 6DOF thrust vector;
* Plotting and animation functions (Matlab);
* Preprocessing functions (Matlab), including data from the Minerva ROV used at NTNU.

# To-do list

Before the software can be considered as fully functional, the following items are required:
* Path planning methods in Matlab;
* Guidance methods (target & trajectory tracking and path following) in Simulink/Matlab;
* ROV control routines (dynamic positioning and path controller) in Simulink;
